quote: "I will rate this firm a 10 out of 10. Their investigative research was very thorough with identifying the neglect and maltreatment of my mother that eventually led to her death in the Nursing Home. The firm kept me updated as to what was going on and the next steps. I could feel that they really cared about my situation with my mother because of their vocal expressions. If needed, I will use this firm again."
