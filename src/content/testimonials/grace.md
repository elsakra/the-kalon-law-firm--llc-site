quote: "My dad passed away suddenly in a nursing home and we felt it the staff may have been negligent, he went downhill so fast. Mr. Holbert explained to us what may have happened, had experts review the records, and built a case and walked us through everything, making the nursing home pay for their negligence. We absolutely recommend him, he's the best."
