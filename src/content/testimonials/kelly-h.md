quote: "I cannot thank Bill Holbert and Joan Woolley enough for the compassion, dedication, and professionalism they showed during one of the most difficult times of my life. After seeing my mom suffer due to someone else's negligence, I felt overwhelmed and unsure of where to turn...Their knowledge and experience were evident, and I always felt confident knowing they were fighting for justice on behalf of my family."
